## 🔐 Security

CompoundChat is built with security as the top priority:

- **Non-custodial**: Users always control their private keys
- **Encrypted storage**: Private keys encrypted with AES-256-GCM
- **No plaintext keys**: Keys never stored or logged unencrypted
- **Webhook verification**: HMAC-SHA256 signature validation
- **Rate limiting**: Protection against abuse
- **Input validation**: All user inputs sanitized
- **Audit-ready**: Independent security review before launch

See [SECURITY.md](./docs/SECURITY.md) for our threat model and security architecture.

## 📊 Testing

We maintain high test coverage for all security-critical code:

```bash
# Run all tests
npm test

# Run specific test suites
npm run test:unit
npm run test:integration
npm run test:e2e

# Watch mode (development)
npm run test:watch

# Coverage report
npm run test:coverage
```

**Coverage Requirements**:
- Security-critical code: **85%+ coverage**
- Overall codebase: **70%+ coverage**
